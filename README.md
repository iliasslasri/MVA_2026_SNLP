### Course Objectives

Speech and natural language processing is a subfield of artificial intelligence used in an increasing number of applications. This course will provide an overview and details of techniques and tasks used in the automatic processing of text and speech, covering certain history aspects of the field, the representation of textual and speech data, language modelling, machine translation, sentiment analysis and other labelling tasks, chatbots and speech synthesis and recognition. The aim is to provide the key principles, algorithms and mathematical principles behind the state of the art, and confronting them with the reality of processing real data. 

Topics:

- speech features & signal processing
- hidden markov & finite state modelling
- word embeddings
- deep learning for NLP (RNNs, transformers)
- neural language modelling, including large language models (LLMs)
- machine translation
- sentiment analysis
- sequence labelling tasks
- chatbots
- evaluation: comparing human and machine performance
- speech synthesis and speech recognition
- code generation and agents


## Prerequisites

Basic linear algebra, calculus, probability theory, basic machine/deep learning

## Organisation

### 9 classes

The course consists of **9 three-hours slots.**

This year, it will take place **in person, on Thursdays from 2pm to 5pm in the Salle des Actes at the Ecole Normale Supérieure, (ENS, 45 rue d'ULM, 5e).**

Each three-hour slot will have a lecture lasting approximately two hours, followed by a quiz and Q&As.

### Evaluation

Evaluation consists of 2 parts:
- **Quizzes** (40% of the total grade): For all classes except from the first and last classes, you will be given a link to an online questionnaire (google form) and will have 30 minutes to complete the questionnaire at the end of the lecture. Any forms submitted after the form is closed will be automatically rejected and graded as zero. The quizzes will contain comprehension questions and the best 6 grades out of the 7 quizzes will be used for the average.
- **Project** (60% of the total grade): You will work in small groups of 2-4 around a recent paper in speech or language processing which has existing code. But you will be evaluated individually on the basis of your engagement in the group work. Your task will be 1) to replicate the main result of the paper, 2) run an experiment testing a new question not tested in the paper (propose another approach/improvement to the task, or make the method work on another task or another dataset). You will present your plan in a one-page document for an initial deadine (23rd January) (specify what you want to do, the planning, and how you will collaborate within the group), and your results in a 4-page document (deadline 26th March) and 10-minute oral presentation (+ 5 minutes of questions) - time slots TBA.

### Project topics

You can find information concerning the projects (topics and evaluation criteria) [here](https://github.com/rbawden/MVA_2026_SNLP/blob/main/projects.md).

### Q&A

_What happens if I get less than 10/20 on average? Can I take another exam?_

Any obtained grade is final, so there is no possibility of resitting the exam.

_What happens if i cannot be present to the course, and therefore cannot do the online quiz?_

Failure to submit the quiz on time will result in a mark of 0/20 for that quiz, unless you can demonstrate that it was materially impossible for you to be present to the course. Such documented requestes should be sent to mva.speech.language@gmail.com together with the name and date of the missed quiz. The best 6 grades out of the 7 quizzes will be used for the average, giving you the possibility of skipping one quiz.

_Will the course be recorded and made available afterwards so that we can watch it later if we’re unable to attend?_

No.
